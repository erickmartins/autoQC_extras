Usage Instructions:

Run plot_history.py. It will look for "summary_PSF.csv" and "summary_power.csv" files inside
your folder of choice, and use the folder name where they are as the date (suggested folder names
should follow the format YYYY-MM-DD). It will generate Plotly HTML files that can be uploaded
to a website for interactive plots.
